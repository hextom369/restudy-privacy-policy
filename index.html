    <h1>Privacy Policy for Restudy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 20, 2025</p> <p>Thank you for using Restudy! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information about you when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flashcard Content:</strong> We store the text and any images you add to your flashcards directly on your device using local storage (<code>shared_preferences</code> or similar). This data is stored locally and is not typically transmitted to our servers unless you use a future cloud sync feature (which would be covered by an updated policy).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advertising Data (via Google AdMob):</strong> We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements within the App. AdMob may collect device identifiers (like the Advertising ID), IP address, device information (model, OS version), location information (if permitted), and information about your interactions with ads. This data is used by Google to provide, personalize, and measure the effectiveness of ads.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Information (Potentially via AdMob):</strong> AdMob may also collect general usage data related to ad interactions. We currently do not implement separate analytics tracking beyond what AdMob provides.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li><strong>Permissions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage/Photos (via Image Picker):</strong> If you choose to add images to your flashcards, the App will request permission to access your photo library or camera via the <code>image_picker</code> plugin. We only access the images you specifically select.</li>
                <li><strong>Microphone (Potentially via Audioplayers):</strong> If future features involve recording audio for flashcards using <code>audioplayers</code>, the App would request microphone permission at that time. Currently, it's likely used only for playback of pre-existing audio files (like beeps).</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required by Google AdMob to fetch and display advertisements.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To store and display your flashcards, play sounds (<code>audioplayers</code>), and enable core app functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>To Display Advertisements:</strong> To support the App financially, we use Google AdMob to display ads. Google uses the data collected to show relevant ads to you.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We may use aggregated, non-identifiable data derived from ad interactions (if available via AdMob reporting) to understand usage patterns and improve the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
     <p>We do not share your personal information except in the following circumstances:</p>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>With Service Providers (Google AdMob):</strong> We share information with Google as necessary to provide advertising services through AdMob. Google's use of this data is governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
         <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) enforce our agreements with you; (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (d) protect the security or integrity of our App; or (e) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Restudy, our users, personnel, or others.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>Our App uses Google AdMob for advertising. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For more information on how Google collects and uses data, please visit Google's Privacy & Terms site: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
        <li>You can often control personalized advertising settings through your device's settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your flashcard content (text and selected images) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.</li>
        <li>We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no electronic transmission or storage is completely secure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flashcard Data:</strong> You can access, modify, and delete the flashcard content you create directly within the Restudy app. Since this data is stored locally, uninstalling the app will typically remove this data from the device (though remnants might exist in device backups depending on system settings).</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Preferences:</strong> You can manage your preferences for personalized advertising through your mobile device's settings, as mentioned in Section 4.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Restudy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our App or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the App to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>
