    <h1>Privacy Policy for Restudy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 20, 2025</p> <p>Thank you for using Restudy! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App"). Our core principle is to minimize data collection.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>We handle information in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Create and Manage Locally:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flashcard Content (Text and Images):</strong> You can create flashcards containing text and images (using the <code>image_picker</code> if you grant permission). This data is stored **strictly locally on your device** using mechanisms like <code>shared_preferences</code> or internal storage. **We, the developers, do not collect, transmit, access, or store your flashcard content on any server.** This data remains entirely under your control on your device.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information Collected Automatically for Ads (via Google AdMob):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> We use Google AdMob to display advertisements, which helps support the App. AdMob, as a third-party service, may collect device identifiers (like the Advertising ID), IP address, device information (model, OS version), general location information, and information about your interactions with ads displayed in the App. This data is collected directly by Google and is used by them to provide, personalize, and measure the effectiveness of ads.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li><strong>Permissions Requested:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage/Photos (Optional, via Image Picker):</strong> If you choose to add images to your flashcards, the App will request permission to access your photo library or camera via the <code>image_picker</code> plugin. We only access the images you specifically select, and these images are stored locally as part of your flashcard data, not collected by us.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required by Google AdMob to fetch and display advertisements.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Playback (Not Collection):</strong> The App uses <code>audioplayers</code> solely for playing back pre-packaged sound files (like timer beeps). **The App does not request microphone permission and does not collect any audio data from your device.**</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information handled is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide App Functionality:</strong> To allow you to create, store (locally), manage, and view your flashcards, and to play notification sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>To Display Advertisements:</strong> To financially support the App through Google AdMob.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
     <p>We do not collect your personal flashcard data, so we cannot share it. The only potential sharing involves data collected directly by third-party services:</p>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Information collected by AdMob (as described in Section 1) is shared with Google for advertising purposes, subject to Google's own privacy policies. We do not share your user-created flashcard content with Google or any other third party.</li>
         <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may be required to disclose information collected by service providers (like AdMob device identifiers associated with ad requests, if compelled) if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if necessary to protect safety, security, or legal rights.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>Our App uses Google AdMob for advertising. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For more information on how Google collects and uses data via AdMob, please review Google's Privacy & Terms site: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
        <li>You can often control personalized advertising settings through your mobile device's settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your flashcard content (text and selected images) is stored exclusively locally on your device.** We, the developers, have no access to this data. The security of this local data depends on the security of your device itself.</li>
        <li>We implement reasonable measures within the app's code, but securing locally stored data primarily relies on the device's operating system security features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flashcard Data Management:</strong> You have full control to create, access, modify, and delete your flashcard content directly within the Restudy app on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Preferences:** You can manage your preferences for personalized advertising via your mobile device's settings, as mentioned in Section 4.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Restudy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information (as defined by applicable laws like COPPA) from children. The data collected by AdMob is subject to Google's policies regarding children.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we handle information.</p>
